<h1 id="step-0-prior-reading">Step 0 - Prior Reading</h1>
<p>Firstly, <strong>please read the Google Season of Docs
<a href="https://developers.google.com/season-of-docs/docs/tech-writer-guide">Technical Writer Guide</a></strong>. It contains a
lot of helpful information about the program and about participating in Google Season of Docs.</p>
<p>Secondly, <strong>please read the Google Season of Docs
<a href="https://developers.google.com/season-of-docs/docs/faq">FAQ</a></strong>.
It contains a link to the timeline, as well as lots of helpful information about the program and how things will run.</p>
<h1 id="step-1-finding-an-idea">Step 1 - Finding an <strong>Idea</strong></h1>
<p>Due to the SymbiFlow project being made up of
<a href="https://symbiflow.github.io/#subprojects">many smaller projects</a> (and as our list of supported platforms grows, that&#39;s not even the full list), there&#39;s plenty to choose from if you&#39;re looking for helping some ambitious projects in need of better documentation.</p>
<p>As selecting a project or understanding an idea can be hard, we recommend you
come join us <a href="https://webchat.freenode.net/?channels=symbiflow">on IRC</a> and
talk to us further about them. A technical writer will not be able to succeed if
they don&#39;t understand the subject matter at least some significant extent, and
talking to us is the best way of learning what SymbiFlow is about and how it works. </p>
<h2 id="symbiflow-presentation">SymbiFlow presentation</h2>
<p>The <a href="http://j.mp/35c3-symbiflow">SymbiFlow talk from 35C3</a> should explain some
details about our current status and where help is needed (see the &quot;How to help&quot;
section of that talk).</p>
<h2 id="project-docs-label"><strong>project-docs</strong> label</h2>
<p>The SymbiFlow project has a
<a href="https://github.com/SymbiFlow/ideas/issues?q=is%3Aopen+is%3Aissue+label%3Atype-docs">dedicated label on a separate issue tracker</a>
which contains tasks which are suitable to be completed as part of GSoD.</p>
<h2 id="can-i-work-on-xxx-">Can I work on XXX?</h2>
<p>If a idea has the <a href="#project-docs-label">project-docs label</a> on our Ideas issue tracker, it&#39;s probably
a good one!</p>
<h2 id="what-should-i-work-on-">What should I work on?</h2>
<p>What do you like to do? What interests you? You might know better what projects are
going to keep you interested than we do - and if you need to know more about SymbiFlow to figure it our, come talk to us on IRC.</p>
<h2 id="is-project-xxx-important-">Is project XXX important?</h2>
<p><strong>For GSoD the most important factor is the application quality!</strong> If the
strongest application is for a lower priority project it is much more likely to
be accepted even if poorer applications exist for higher priority projects.</p>

<h2 id="tips">Tips</h2>
<p>After reviewing many proposals there are a couple of things that many seem to
be lacking. This list of tips should help you fix common mistakes and help make
your proposals better.</p>
<h3 id="tip-1-include-irc-nickname"><strong>Tip 1</strong> - Include IRC Nickname</h3>
<p>Include your IRC nick as the first thing in the detailed description.</p>
<p>During Season of Docs many new people turn up, keeping you all straight
is hard for us. Specially when your IRC nick, email address and real name have
no resemblance.</p>
<h3 id="tip-2-project-first-resume-second"><strong>Tip 2</strong> - <strong>Project First</strong>, Resume Second</h3>
<p>We are most interested in your proposal for the project. If your proposal looks
good we may then look at your resume / personal description.</p>
<p>Hence, include the project information first and your personal stuff second.</p>
<h3 id="tip-3-we-are-not-mind-readers"><strong>Tip 3</strong> - We are not mind readers</h3>
<p><strong>Anything which is not linked to from your proposal effectively does not
exist.</strong> I&#39;m afraid we can not (yet) read your mind.</p>
<p>It is unlikely that we will remember that IRC conversation we had about XYZ.
Other mentors may not have seen that conversation either.</p>
<p>If you have thought about a certain way to do something tell us, even if you
decided that it was not feasible. If you had an important IRC conversation
which resulted in changing the way you think, link too the logs. If a web page
was influential tell us about it!</p>
<h3 id="tip-4-submit-now-"><strong>Tip 4</strong> - Submit now!</h3>
<p>Do not leave it to the last minute as you won&#39;t have time to update the
proposal based on feedback. There is still plenty of time for mentors to give
feedback and you to update your proposal.</p>
<h3 id="tip-5-make-your-application-public"><strong>Tip 5</strong> - Make your application public</h3>
<p>Having a public application means not only can mentors give you feedback but
other students and the general community can too!</p>
<p>Using a wiki is a good idea because it lets us look at the history of how your
proposal has evolved. It also means you can have formatting making it easier to
read.</p>
<h3 id="tip-6-splitting-applications-which-are-too-big"><strong>Tip 6</strong> - Splitting applications which are too big</h3>
<p>Google limits the text you can submit for your detailed description characters.
This can be quite limited if you have some detailed information.
Hence, It is recommended that you produce two versions of your application.</p>
<p>A &quot;cut back&quot; version which fits into the character limit. This should be all
the very important bits of your application. There should be enough meat in this section to
convince us to look at your further URL.</p>
<p>The URL in the document should link to your full proposal. Feel free to add
anything which you feel is relevant.</p>
<p>This linked proposal you should also include your complete Google application.
The text which is being duplicated should be clearly marked in a different
colour but still readable. Assume that clicking the link replace the Google
application with the page and we can no longer remember the original proposal.</p>
<p><strong>Remember quality is better than quantity!</strong></p>
<hr>

<h2 id="selection-criteria">Selection Criteria</h2>
<p>The following gives some indication of some of the things we are looking for.</p>
<p>There is some subjective elements to judging applications, but it&#39;s hoped that
by trying to quantify the decision process, it&#39;ll help people understand why
their application was or was not accepted.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Proposal is longer than a few sentences.</strong> - We need some meat in the proposal in order to even consider it.</li>
<li><strong>Proposer has contacted us prior to the submission.</strong> - This demonstrates a definite interest in SymbiFlow and proves an ability to communicate with us.</li>
<li><strong>Proposal is well written.</strong> - While we don&#39;t expect perfect English, we do expect that the proposer took time to spell check, proofread it, organize it logically, and use comprehensible grammar.</li>
<li><strong>Proposal demonstrates understanding of subject matter.</strong> - We expect the proposer to do some research, ask questions, and gain some understanding of the project they&#39;re proposing. This gives us confidence that they&#39;ll be able to complete the project successfully.</li>
<li><strong>Proposal shows creativity.</strong> We like to see someone thinking outside the box, including proposing ideas for projects we hadn&#39;t listed.</li>
<li><strong>Proposal is the only submission for the given task.</strong> - Many proposals focus on the same few tasks, so if you&#39;re the only person proposing to do a given project, that weighs in your favor.</li>
<li><strong>Proposal shows implementation planning.</strong> - If the author has broken the work out into a task list, it shows that they know what they&#39;ll be doing.</li>
<li><strong>Proposal scope is realistic.</strong> - 12 weeks goes fast. Proposals that are promising too much are unlikely to be completed in a timely fashion.</li>
<li><strong>Proposal shows motivation.</strong> - While it&#39;s important to describe the project in detail and show us that you have the necessary skills, do not forget to communicate your motivation, i.e. why you want to work for us on this particular project.</li>
</ul>
<p>The following are conditions that result in automatic rejection:</p>
<ul>
<li>Group project proposed. Google has specified that groups MAY NOT participate. Individuals only.</li>
<li>Proposer is not a student. Google has specified this as a requirement of the GSoC program.</li>
</ul>
<h1 id="how-to-ask-for-help">How to ask for help</h1>
<p>Google Season of Docs will require you to work independently and hence showing
independent investigation and troubleshooting skills <strong>is a must</strong>. We
definitely encourage asking questions of the mentors but you must demonstrate
researching the question.</p>
<p>Some good pages to look for tips about writing good questions can be found below;</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="http://www.catb.org/esr/faqs/smart-questions.html">How To Ask Questions The Smart Way - Eric Steven Raymond</a></li>
<li><a href="http://www.cplusplus.com/articles/jLzyhbRD/">How To: Ask Questions The Smart Way - C++ Articles</a></li>
</ul>
<p>Often the best way to ask questions is to start writing your Google Season of Docs proposal as documented in the <a href="#writing-proposals">Writing Proposals</a> section and find out what areas you are getting stuck at.</p>
